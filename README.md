# Fracture-Conditions-Paper-Data
Data used in Wells-Moran et al., 2024


All crevasse maps are based off of 2014 MODIS Mosaic of Antarctica optical imagery and strain rate fields derived from 2014 ITS_LIVE velocity fields. 

Predicted fracture maps show 0 where a fracture is predicted and 1 where stress states fall within the various yield criteria.
